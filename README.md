UI Festival - A shitty* fork of UI Party Mod for Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever
<br/>*all features unrelated to split screen got removed


The basic features are
- configurable UI Element positions, so that also people with left screen primary setup can enjoy this mod
- ability to split the screen at configurable ratio and per side configurable top/bottom margins for people with unequal screen heights
- ability to make most of other split screen unaware mods use right side as primary rendering surface
- works with coop missions


Known bugs
- mod settings window is fixed and dosn't respect boundries
  <br/>workaround (thanks to MrNukealizer): try to edit settings directly in<br/>`%AppData%\Local\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\Game.prefs` 

Installation
- copy mod to your Forged Alliance mods folder and make sure it's name `ui-festival` (not `ui-festival-master`)
